## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

In building this dashboard, created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page, a page where one can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where other can view the data used to build them.


The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots ["Navigation Menu" section](#navigation-menu) (notice the background color change).

Finally, the website deployed to GitHub pages.


* Use a bootstrap theme to customize your website. Used a tool like [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). 
* Added extra visualizations for better comparisons.
* Use meaningful glyphicons next to links in the header.
* Have visualization navigation on every visualizations page with an active state.
